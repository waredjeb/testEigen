# testEigen
A standalone test code ported with the Alpaka library and its user interface Cupla. 
The initial version of the code come from https://github.com/cms-patatrack/cmssw/tree/CMSSW_11_0_X_Patatrack/RecoPixelVertexing/PixelTrackFitting/test . Just the ```testEigenGpuNoFit.cu``` has been used for this purpose.
